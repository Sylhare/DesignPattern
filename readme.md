## Design Pattern

### Introduction
[Design pattern](http://abrillant.developpez.com/tutoriel/java/design/pattern/introduction/) are best practices for Object Oriented software developers. This best practice enhance reusability and maintenance of the code.

There are [23 official design patterns](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/design_pattern_overview.htm) (from _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Software_ by the _Gang of Four_) for Java. They are classed into four groups:

- 	[Creational Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern) that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
- 	[Structural Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern) that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
- 	[Behavioral Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern) that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
- 	[Concurancy Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_pattern) that deal with the multi-threaded programming paradigm.
